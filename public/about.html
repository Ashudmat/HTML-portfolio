<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi! I am Ashutosh Sharma. A fullstack developer having great grip on MERN
  stack i.e. basically MongoDB Express.js React.js Node.js
</p>

<p>
  MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js help you build the backend of an application,
  while React powers the frontend. Node.js and React rank as the two most
  popular web frameworks and technologies, according to the most recent Stack
  Overflow developer survey. And MongoDB is also one of the most popular
  databases for developers. About 21 million websites use React to power their
  frontend. These statistics should give you a clear idea of how stable and
  popular these technologies are.
</p>

<p>
  Like any web stack, you can build whatever you want in MERN — though it’s
  ideally suited for cases that are JSON-heavy, cloud-native, and that have
  dynamic web interfaces. Examples include workflow management, news
  aggregation, to-do apps and calendars, and interactive forums/social products
  — and whatever else you can dream up!
